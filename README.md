# Mini Store Layout

### How to use the app
- Click items from the UI to place them into the layout.
- Click the object to make actions on the object (Move, Rotate, Remove)
- Move or rotate placed objects using on-screen buttons.

### What Iâ€™d add with more time
- Fix Bugs (Moving the object & Adding the object to the floor has some slightly glitches issues)
- Enable camera movement
- Snap-to-grid placement
- Save/load layout state
